# HoloFame
This is a Unity Project for HoloLens used in the #HoloTouringFall conference sessions Real World HoloLens Development with Unity by Rene Schulte presented at Unite LA 2016 and VRDC 2016. http://rene-schulte.info

The demo project is a simple HoloLens demonstrating how to interact with thereal-world environment.  
The project implements the basic HoloLens input and output paradigms like GGV:
* Gaze: The user can gaze to find a position for an object.
* Gesture: The user can air-tap to place the object.
* Voice: The user can use voice commands for various inputs.
* Spatial Mapping: The built-in spatial mapping components are used for placement and occlusion. 
* Hand proximity: The user can use the hand to touch virtual objects.
